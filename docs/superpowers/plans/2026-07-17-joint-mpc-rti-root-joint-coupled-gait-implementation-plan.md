# Joint MPC RTI Root-Joint Coupled Gait Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build the approved pure-kinematic H30 root-joint rolling RTI gait, close the representative flat/small-obstacle behavior gate, then make the realistic 1024-env synchronous field+H30 MPC complete 1000 updates in at most 5.0s and freshly rerun both gates on one final candidate.

**Architecture:** Keep `dt=0.02`, measured x0, published x1, `H=30`, the fixed 24-frame diagonal trot with 12 swing and 12 stance frames, one QP and exactly one SQP/RTI update per cycle, five line-search alphas `(1.0,0.5,0.25,0.125,0.0)`, four filters and seven loss families. Cold construction is allowed exactly once per initialized lifecycle; later cycles are warm-only. Task 14E adds one explicit pre-LQ warm operation that maps only continuing-stance x1 leg joints back to the persistent-anchor manifold while preserving foot z and every other state component. Stage B and formal/ranked acceptance remain blocked until the representative viewer is green.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.10, PyTorch, torch.compile, CUDA/C++, SQP-RTI/GGN/Riccati, pytest, Isaac Lab in `/mnt/mydisk/lhy/anaconda3/envs/env_isaacsim`.

## File Map

- Create `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/joint_metrics.py`: shared trace and metric accumulator.
- Create `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/acceptance_thresholds.py`: applicability, thresholds and per-cell aggregation.
- Create `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/scenario_matrix.py`: flat/small/stop/large/step scenario rows.
- Create `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/run_joint_acceptance.py`: unified Stage A/Stage C runner.
- Create `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/horizon_exploration.py`: deterministic H16-H50 candidate construction, screening reports and shortest-passing selection.
- Create `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_joint_metrics.py` and `test_coupled_gait.py`.
- Modify `config.py`, `types.py`, `model/go2_kinematics.py`, `losses/command.py`, `losses/contact.py`, `planner.py`, `solver/primal_dual_ilqr.py`, `solver/sqp_rti.py`.
- Refactor existing crossing/stop/behavior probes to consume the shared metrics.
- Stage B may modify `terrain/csrc/work_efficient_edt_cuda.cu`, `terrain/cuda_edt.py` and the coupled solver only after fixed-H30 Stage A passes and H30 profiling identifies the largest component.

## Execution Status At Amendment

- Tasks 1-3 are committed as `b78d392`, `08a00a7`, `635eaad`.
- Tasks 4-5 have focused coupled tests passing but remain open until the inherited crossing/stop/packed-query gates recover.
- Tasks 6-7 and every Stage B/C task remain open.

## 2026-07-18 H30 Adaptive-Contact Amendment

This section supersedes the horizon-selection portions of Tasks 8-9 and every later reference to a variable `H_selected`. Tasks 1-7 remain inherited correctness work. The production and acceptance horizon is now exactly H30 with `half_cycle_steps=15`; H16 is diagnostic history only. Implementation must follow the approved Chinese HTML design at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-joint-mpc-rti-h30-adaptive-contact-root-assist-design.html`.

The mandatory completion order is:

1. Stage A: make H30 behavior, safety, JointMetrics, real viewer and all inherited regressions pass together.
2. Stage B: only after Stage A is green, make realistic idle-GPU `1024 x H30 x 1000 <=5000ms` pass without changing Stage A contracts.
3. Stage C: on one final candidate, freshly rerun complete Stage A and complete Stage B; both latest results must pass.

### Task 8A: Fix The Production H30 Contract

**Files:** modify `Go2Pvcnn/extension/joint_mpc_rti/config.py`, `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_horizon_exploration.py`, `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_solver.py`.

- [ ] Write RED assertions:

```python
def test_production_horizon_is_h30_full_cycle():
    cfg = JointMpcRtiCfg()
    assert cfg.runtime.horizon_steps == 30
    assert cfg.gait.half_cycle_steps == 15
    assert cfg.runtime.horizon_steps == 2 * cfg.gait.half_cycle_steps
    assert cfg.solver.line_search_alphas == (1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1)
```

- [ ] Run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=Go2Pvcnn /mnt/mydisk/lhy/anaconda3/envs/env_isaacsim/bin/python -m pytest \
  Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_horizon_exploration.py \
  Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_solver.py -q
```

Expected before implementation: the H30 production-default assertion fails.

- [ ] Set the exact H30/15/15/four-alpha defaults. Remove production selection of shorter candidates; retain exploration helpers only as diagnostic utilities.
- [ ] Run the same tests and require pass. Commit `feat: fix joint mpc production horizon to h30`.

### Task 8B: Per-Leg Contact State And Fixed-Shape Schedule

**Files:** modify `Go2Pvcnn/extension/joint_mpc_rti/types.py`, `model/gait_schedule.py`, `planner.py`; create/modify `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_coupled_gait.py`.

- [ ] Write RED tests that construct `[B,4]` contact, phase age, extension age, stance age and recovery tensors and require a fixed `[B,31,4]` mask. Verify one diagonal leg can confirm stance while its mate remains swing, and that a future liftoff is blocked when it would leave fewer than two reliable stance legs.
- [ ] Run `pytest Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_coupled_gait.py -k 'per_leg or liftoff_guard' -q`; expect failure because solver state and scheduler are global-phase only.
- [ ] Extend `JointMpcRtiSolverState` with:

```python
contact_state: Tensor | None = None
phase_age: Tensor | None = None
swing_extension_age: Tensor | None = None
stance_age: Tensor | None = None
recovery_state: Tensor | None = None
```

- [ ] Implement tensor-only schedule generation; no Python branching by environment. Preserve fixed shapes for CUDA Graph. Run focused tests and commit `feat: add per leg joint mpc contact scheduler`.

### Task 8C: Grounded And Full-Body-Safe Touchdown

**Files:** modify `planner.py`, `types.py`, `runtime/cuda_graph.py`, `model/go2_kinematics.py`; modify `test_coupled_gait.py`, `test_rolling_runtime.py`, `test_losses.py`.

- [ ] Write RED cases for: airborne scheduled touchdown; grounded foot on small semantic; foot safe but knee/calf/thigh collision; foot/leg safe but base collision; safe current touchdown with x1/x2 collision; and fully safe touchdown.
- [ ] Require the first five cases to remain non-stance without an anchor update. Require the safe case to set `anchor_xy=current_foot_xy` and `anchor_z=terrain_height+foot_contact_offset`.
- [ ] Require independent touchdown, extension ages `1..10`, no forced stance at age 10, grounded-but-unsafe recovery, and root progress scale `clamp(1-age/10,0,1)`.
- [ ] Add graph-safe clone/copy/reset handling for all new solver-state tensors.
- [ ] Run focused contact/runtime/CUDA Graph tests and commit `feat: confirm safe joint mpc touchdown`.

### Task 8D: Bounded Root Lateral And RPY Assistance

**Files:** modify `config.py`, `planner.py`, `losses/posture.py`; modify `test_coupled_gait.py`, `test_solver.py`.

- [ ] Write RED finite-difference/LQ tests proving small-obstacle residuals can generate root lateral, roll, pitch and yaw directions while root Z remains excluded. Verify early swing uses less root assistance than mid-swing and reduced joint margin continuously increases assistance.
- [ ] Add exact config bounds:

```python
root_lateral_offset_limit_m = 0.06
root_lateral_velocity_error_limit_mps = 0.20
root_roll_pitch_limit_rad = math.radians(6.0)
root_roll_pitch_rate_limit_rps = 0.6
root_yaw_error_limit_rad = math.radians(10.0)
root_yaw_rate_error_limit_rps = 0.8
```

- [ ] Replace pure command-axis root XY projection with `P_parallel + w_assist * P_lateral`; scale root RPY collision Jacobians by the same continuous SDF/phase/reachability weight.
- [ ] Project every line-search candidate through per-frame control clamps and integrated nominal-relative state clamps before nonlinear FK/merit evaluation. Run focused tests and commit `feat: plan bounded root obstacle assistance`.

### Task 8E: Full-Body Small-Obstacle LQ Directions

**Files:** modify `model/go2_kinematics.py`, `planner.py`, `losses/semantic.py`, `losses/rollout_objective.py`; modify `test_kinematics_gait.py`, `test_losses.py`, `test_solver.py`.

- [ ] Write RED tests for nonzero, finite and correctly directed foot/knee/calf/thigh/base signed-distance gradients and Gauss-Newton blocks. Verify each part changes the LQ direction, not only final merit.
- [ ] Add explicit knee and base sample Jacobians to the packed geometry query and small-obstacle linearization. Use the same radii/top-height overlap detector in LQ, merit, line-search violation and JointMetrics.
- [ ] Verify root-leg cross blocks remain symmetric and dense parity stays within `2e-5`. Commit `feat: optimize all joint mpc body clearances`.

### Task 8F: Complete JointMetrics And 275-Command Matrix

**Files:** modify `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/joint_metrics.py`; create/modify `acceptance_thresholds.py`, `scenario_matrix.py`, `run_joint_acceptance.py`, `test_joint_metrics.py`, `small_obstacle_attitude_probe.py`.

- [ ] Write RED contract tests requiring exactly:

```python
VX = (0.0, -0.2, 0.2, -0.4, 0.4, -0.6, 0.6, -0.8, 0.8, -1.0, 1.0)
VY = (0.0, -0.3, 0.3, -0.5, 0.5)
YAW = (0.0, -0.5, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0)
assert len(tuple(product(VX, VY, YAW))) == 275
```

- [ ] Extend `JointMetricTrace` and the accumulator with every field in design section 7, including root roll/pitch mean/P95/abs-max, root lateral/yaw deviations, touchdown readiness/extension/recovery, reliable support/liftoff guard, foot/knee/calf/thigh/base phase collisions, joint/root clamp hits and alpha histograms/rejection reasons.
- [ ] Require small-obstacle per-cell root roll/pitch abs max `<=6deg`, every part collision rate `0`, airborne/unsafe/forced touchdown `0`, alpha=0 global `<=5%`, per-cell `<=10%`, consecutive run `<=2`, plus all inherited thresholds.
- [ ] Ensure reports carry raw `(vx,vy,yaw_rate)`, numerator, denominator, valid count, N/A reason and worst key. Run metric tests and commit `test: unify h30 adaptive contact metrics`.

### Task 9A: Close Stage A On Fixed H30

**Files:** only files implicated by focused RED failures; update `run_joint_acceptance.py` and create a Stage A evidence log.

- [ ] Run focused tests after each single-cause change, then run the entire fixed-H30 matrix. No H16/H20 fallback is allowed.
- [ ] Require all 275 commands in every applicable flat/small/stop/large/terrain matrix, all five small shapes, phase/placement/recovery coverage, and no omitted universal metric.
- [ ] Run all joint MPC tests, all inherited legacy MPC/reward/viewer tests, real Isaac nine-command plus high-speed/mixed playback, and manager construction for `1/40/512/1024`.
- [ ] Record every worst metric and failure cell. Stage A passes only when the complete latest run is green. Commit `fix: close h30 joint mpc stage a`.

### Task 10A: Stage B H30 Performance Gate

This task is blocked until Task 9A passes. It supersedes every Stage B reference to `H_selected` with H30 and preserves the recorded CUDA Graph/Triton progress.

- [ ] On idle GPU run realistic synchronous exact signed field + H30 MPC for 1024 environments and 1000 updates with 11x11/41x41 footprints, four alpha candidates and all Stage A geometry/losses.
- [ ] Require total `<=5000ms`, mean `<=5ms`, field version `+1000`, nonfinite `0`, stable memory. Optimize only measured bottlenecks and rerun Stage A after every accepted performance change.

### Task 14A: Final Same-Candidate Joint Verification

This task is blocked until Task 10A passes.

- [ ] Record final HEAD and fixed H30 configuration.
- [ ] Freshly rerun complete Stage A.
- [ ] Freshly rerun complete Stage B on the same HEAD.
- [ ] Mark completion only if both latest reports pass; otherwise return to the failing stage and later rerun both.

### Task 14E: Warm Published-x1 Continuing-Stance Manifold Initialization

Task 14E follows the behavior-rejected but solver-correct Task 14D published-root XY priority. The shifted old x2 becomes the next warm x1 even though old x2 was never constrained by the published support KKT. This task changes only warm nominal construction; it does not add a second QP/SQP, candidate repair, recovery, semantic branch, terrain XY projection, or another loss/filter.

**Files:** modify `Go2Pvcnn/extension/joint_mpc_rti/model/nominal.py`, `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_nominal.py`, and only direct contract tests that expose the same nominal state through the existing QP/line-search/RTI APIs. Update `notes/todo.md`, `notes/todo/T302v-joint-mpc-rti-gpu.md`, `notes/log/index.md`, and one Task 14E evidence log.

- [x] Write a RED helper fixture that creates an initialized phase-12 warm row, shifts old x2 into new x1, and leaves both continuing-stance feet 6mm away from their persistent XY anchors. Assert the precondition with real FK rather than a mocked foot position.

```python
continuing = schedule.stance[:, 0] & schedule.stance[:, 1]
before_foot = go2_fk(shifted[:, 1, :3], shifted[:, 1, 3:6], shifted[:, 1, 6:]).foot_pos_w
assert torch.allclose(
    torch.linalg.vector_norm(before_foot[..., :2] - persistent_anchor[..., :2], dim=-1)[continuing],
    torch.full((2,), 0.006),
    atol=2.0e-5,
    rtol=0.0,
)
```

- [x] Add RED assertions for the exact approved map. For `continuing_i = stance_i(x0) AND stance_i(x1)`, preserve the shifted FK z and replace only target XY with the persistent anchor before calling the existing batched analytic IK:

```python
shifted_foot_1 = go2_fk(state[:, 1, :3], state[:, 1, 3:6], state[:, 1, 6:]).foot_pos_w
target_foot_1 = torch.cat((persistent_anchor[..., :2], shifted_foot_1[..., 2:3]), dim=-1)
ik_joint_1, reachable = go2_analytic_ik(state[:, 1, :3], state[:, 1, 3:6], target_foot_1)
```

Require continuing-stance FK XY error `<=2e-5m`, preserved FK z `<=2e-5m`, and exact invariance of x0, x1 root position/RPY, x2..x30, swing legs and x0->x1 touchdown-onset legs.

- [x] Run the focused RED test and require failure because current `_build_warm_nominal` returns the shifted state unchanged:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=Go2Pvcnn /mnt/mydisk/lhy/anaconda3/envs/env_isaacsim/bin/python -m pytest \
  Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_nominal.py \
  -k 'published_x1 or manifold' -q
```

- [x] Implement one tensor-only helper in `model/nominal.py`. It must return corrected `[B,31,18]` state and a `[B]` validity mask. Apply IK joints with `torch.where(continuing[...,None], ik_joint_1, shifted_joint_1)`, rebuild only node x1, and leave every other node byte-for-byte unchanged. No Python loop or per-environment branch is allowed.

- [x] Define helper validity as terrain/reference validity AND finite corrected state AND continuing-leg geometric reachability AND x1 joint position bounds AND the existing `30rad/s * 0.02s` x0->x1 joint-step bound. A failed initialized row remains `used_warm_start=True`; it becomes nominal-invalid and never clears `previous.initialized` or selects cold construction.

```python
position_ok = ((joint_1 >= joint_lower) & (joint_1 <= joint_upper)).all(dim=-1)
velocity_ok = ((joint_1 - state[:, 0, 6:]).abs() <= cfg.solver.joint_velocity_limit * cfg.runtime.dt).all(dim=-1)
manifold_valid = (
    torch.where(continuing, reachable & torch.isfinite(ik_joint_1).all(dim=-1), True).all(dim=-1)
    & position_ok
    & velocity_ok
)
```

- [x] Run the focused GREEN test, then add invalid-path RED/GREEN cases for unreachable target, IK joint-position violation and x0->x1 velocity violation. Each case must assert `valid=False`, `used_warm_start=True`, `used_cold_start=False`, and unchanged lifecycle initialization in one planner step when a nonzero accepted candidate does not recover it.

- [x] Add direct downstream contract tests: the mixed support target for initialized continuing stance is numerically zero after nominal construction; alpha zero passes the exact-FK continuing-stance portion of `published_kinematics`; batches `B=1/40/512/1024` preserve fixed shapes and finite valid rows.

- [x] Run the focused nominal/QP/line-search/RTI/backend union. Keep `step_z=4`, `contact_future_onset_xy=1`, `joint_velocity_limit=30`, fixed x1 root XY, six mixed KKT rows, five alphas, four filters and seven losses unchanged.

- [x] Run only the same real S4 sphere `small_forward` representative viewer on `cuda:1`. Record validity, phases 13..23 candidate filters, continuing-stance gap, airborne touchdown, root tracking, clearance, stance slip/anchor, collision, penetration, lifecycle, and joint step. If validity/support/touchdown close but the phase `23->0` joint step remains above `0.35rad`, close Task 14E and create a separate Task 14F design decision; do not change velocity limits or loss weights in Task 14E.

**2026-07-22 execution result:** Task 14E code and focused tests are complete, but the representative behavior gate is RED. Verification is `124 passed` for nominal/loss/QP/scan/line-search/RTI/backend, `47 passed` for contract/IK/gait/terrain, and `28 passed` for final nominal, with static checks passing. The real viewer has validity `1.0`, no invalid cycles, root velocity `0.10739m/s`, joint step `0.34683rad`, stance slip `0.338mm`, and clearance `+9.276um`; however stance ground gap is `84.63mm`, airborne touchdown is `0.020408`, and stance-root carry ratio is `29.72`. Stop at the plan's failed manifold gate: do not start Task 14F, ranked/formal or Stage B. The next approved plan amendment must decide whether continuing-stance z and touchdown-onset z belong in nominal manifold initialization without turning it into post-solve repair or another optimization.

### Task 14E-Z: Warm Published-x1 All-Stance Ground Manifold

User approved方案 A on 2026-07-22. This task remains inside pre-LQ warm nominal construction and the existing fourth line-search filter. It does not change the six-row mixed KKT, fixed x1 root XY, one-QP/one-RTI contract, five alphas, seven losses, H30, `step_z=4`, `contact_future_onset_xy=1`, or `joint_velocity_limit=30`.

**Files:** modify `Go2Pvcnn/extension/joint_mpc_rti/model/nominal.py`, `Go2Pvcnn/extension/joint_mpc_rti/solver/line_search.py`, `Go2Pvcnn/extension/joint_mpc_rti/solver/sqp_rti.py`, and focused tests in `test_nominal.py`, `test_line_search_v2.py`, `test_trajectory_qp.py`, and `test_rti_pipeline.py`. Update the T302v dashboard/log evidence after verification.

- [x] Write nominal RED tests for phase 12 continuing stance and phase 11 touchdown onset. For every x1 stance leg, query raw terrain at the approved target XY and require exact-FK Z equal to `height_w + foot_contact_offset` within `2e-5m`. Continuing XY must equal the persistent anchor; onset XY must equal shifted-x1 FK XY. Assert x0, x1 root/RPY, x1 swing joints, and x2..x30 remain byte-for-byte unchanged.

- [x] Run the focused nominal RED test and require the current implementation to fail because it preserves shifted z for continuing legs and leaves onset legs unchanged:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=Go2Pvcnn /mnt/mydisk/lhy/anaconda3/envs/env_isaacsim/bin/python -m pytest \
  Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_nominal.py \
  -k 'all_stance_ground or touchdown_onset_ground' -q
```

- [x] Extend `_initialize_published_stance_manifold` with the terrain field. Build `continuing`, `onset`, and `published_stance=stance[:,1]`; choose target XY with `torch.where(continuing[...,None], anchor_xy, shifted_foot_xy)`; query raw `height_w`; form target Z as raw height plus `foot_contact_offset`; run the existing batched analytic IK; and replace only published-stance x1 joints. No Python environment/leg loop is allowed.

- [x] Preserve warm-only invalid semantics. Require terrain query validity, all published-stance IK reachability/finite, x1 joint position bounds, x0-to-x1 velocity bounds, and finite corrected state. Invalid rows stay `used_warm_start=True`, `used_cold_start=False`, and keep lifecycle initialization.

- [x] Write line-search RED tests that keep continuing XY masking unchanged while adding an all-x1-stance ground mask. Query raw height independently at each candidate XY and reject both gap and penetration when `abs(foot_z-height-foot_contact_offset) > published_stance_tolerance`. Keep `FILTER_NAMES` exactly four entries and preserve the existing swing safe-floor behavior.

- [x] Extend `parallel_line_search` and `sqp_rti_update` minimally: pass `published_stance_ground_mask=context.schedule.stance[:,1]`, reuse `published_terrain_field`, combine ground validity with continuing XY and swing Z into the existing `published_kinematics` boolean, and reuse `published_stance_tolerance=0.0005m` rather than adding a scalar.

- [x] Add direct QP/RTI contracts: the initialized nominal keeps continuing stance support XY target at numerical zero; alpha zero passes continuing XY plus all-stance Z; onset XY remains unconstrained by the continuing filter; batch sizes `1/40/512/1024` preserve fixed shapes and finite valid rows.

- [x] Run focused nominal/QP/scan/line-search/RTI/backend tests, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check`. Then run only the same real S4 sphere `small_forward` viewer on `cuda:1`. Record ground gap, airborne touchdown, penetration, validity, joint step, root tracking, stance XY, swing clearance, collision, crossing, cold/warm lifecycle, and candidate filters. Do not run ranked/formal or Stage B unless every representative gate is green.

**2026-07-22 execution result:** implementation and focused contracts pass (`127 passed` plus `47 passed`, `py_compile` and diff check green), but representative behavior is RED. At the worst onset, the approved shifted XY queries a `100.26mm` raw small-obstacle surface, so grounding places the foot center at `122.26mm`; the next continuing step drops it to ordinary ground and causes `joint_step=0.59164rad`. Final viewer metrics include `stance_ground_gap=100.75mm`, `airborne_touchdown=0.020408`, validity `0.97959`, and one phase-23 all-alpha published-kinematics rejection. Keep ranked/formal, Task 14F and Stage B blocked. A new approved architecture decision must address touchdown XY ownership or pre-touchdown descent timing; do not tune scalars or relax gates inside Task 14E-Z.

## Stage A — Behavior And Joint Metrics

### Task 1: Shared JointMetrics

**Files:** create `joint_metrics.py`, `acceptance_thresholds.py`, `test_joint_metrics.py`.

- [ ] Write RED tests: a trace with `root_step=4mm`, `stance_foot_step=4mm`, zero swing-relative motion must fail `stance_root_carry_ratio`, `swing_active_motion_ratio` and startup lead; a crossing-success trace with 2mm stance slip must still fail its scenario cell.
- [ ] Run RED:

```bash
/mnt/mydisk/lhy/anaconda3/envs/env_isaacsim/bin/python -m pytest Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_joint_metrics.py -q
```

- [ ] Implement these fixed contracts:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class JointMetricTrace:
    root_pos_w: Tensor
    root_rpy_w: Tensor
    foot_pos_w: Tensor
    contact_state: Tensor
    command_body: Tensor
    foot_height_w: Tensor
    foot_small_distance_m: Tensor
    part_collision: dict[str, Tensor]
    valid: Tensor

THRESHOLDS = {
    "stance_xy_slip_max_m": ("le", 0.0005),
    "stance_xy_slip_mean_m": ("le", 0.0002),
    "stance_stationary_ratio": ("ge", 1.0),
    "stance_root_carry_ratio_abs": ("le", 0.10),
    "swing_active_motion_ratio": ("ge", 0.50),
    "foot_root_lead_time_min_ms": ("ge", 20.0),
    "foot_root_lead_time_max_ms": ("le", 80.0),
    "root_leak_before_foot_m": ("le", 0.0005),
}
```

- [ ] Keep `None` for mathematically inapplicable events; require explicit opportunity coverage and never treat N/A as success.
- [ ] Run GREEN and commit `test: unify joint mpc gait metrics`.

### Task 2: Complete Root-Joint Foot Jacobian

**Files:** modify `model/go2_kinematics.py`, `test_kinematics_gait.py`.

- [ ] Write RED finite-difference tests for output `[B,4,3,18]`: translation block is identity, unrelated leg blocks are zero, root RPY and corresponding leg blocks match central differences.
- [ ] Run RED with `pytest .../test_kinematics_gait.py -k complete_foot_jacobian -q`.
- [ ] Implement:

```python
J = zeros(B, 4, 3, 18)
J[..., :3] = I3
J[..., 3:6] = d_rotation_times_point_d_rpy(root_rpy_w, foot_body)
J[:, leg, :, 6 + 3*leg : 9 + 3*leg] = foot_jacobian_leg(...)
```

- [ ] Run the complete kinematics suite and commit `feat: add complete root joint foot jacobian`.

### Task 3: Correct Dense Coupled LQ Baseline

**Files:** modify `solver/primal_dual_ilqr.py`, `solver/sqp_rti.py`, `config.py`, `test_solver.py`.

- [ ] Write RED random-SPD LQ tests with nonzero root-leg cross terms; compare state/control direction to a direct dense reference and require both root and leg movement.
- [ ] Run RED with `pytest .../test_solver.py -k coupled -q`; current root/diagonal solver must disagree.
- [ ] Replace diagonal division of dense control Hessians with a batched Cholesky solve:

```python
chol, info = torch.linalg.cholesky_ex(Huu_regularized)
K = torch.cholesky_solve(Hux, chol)
k = torch.cholesky_solve(gu.unsqueeze(-1), chol).squeeze(-1)
```

- [ ] Add explicit `coupled_state_riccati=True`; never select the old Go2 block solver when coupling is enabled.
- [ ] Run all solver tests and commit `fix: preserve coupled lq cross blocks`.

### Task 4: Scheduled Stance Equality

**Files:** modify `types.py`, `config.py`, `planner.py`; create `test_coupled_gait.py`.

- [ ] Write RED: inject a 4mm stance anchor error; require nonzero symmetric root-leg Hessian, simultaneous root/joint correction, reduced residual after one RTI, and max rolling stance slip at most 0.5mm.
- [ ] Extend solver state:

```python
stance_dual: Tensor | None = None
command_start_age: Tensor | None = None
command_start_origin_w: Tensor | None = None
previous_command_body: Tensor | None = None
```

- [ ] Add equality penalty/dual-step/tolerance config and assemble:

```python
c = foot_w - stance_anchor_surface_w
g += J.transpose(-1, -2) @ (dual + rho * c)
H += rho * J.transpose(-1, -2) @ J
dual_next = dual + dual_step * rho * c_x1
```

- [ ] Put the same constraint violation in nonlinear merit diagnostics; do not postprocess x1.
- [ ] Run `test_coupled_gait.py` plus `test_behavior.py`; commit `feat: enforce coupled stance equalities`.

### Task 5: Horizon Command And Touchdown Targets

**Files:** modify `losses/command.py`, `losses/contact.py`, `planner.py`, `test_coupled_gait.py`.

- [ ] Write RED for forward/back/left/right/diagonal at 0.1/0.2/0.4m/s: every complete swing has positive relative-root progress, correct touchdown direction, mean active ratio at least 0.5 and monotonic speed-conditioned lead.
- [ ] Change the primary translation task to horizon average progress:

```python
v_avg_body = Rz(-yaw0) @ (root_xy_H - root_xy_0) / (H * dt)
r_progress = v_avg_body - command_xy
```

- [ ] Build `[B,H+1,4,3]` swing targets from current feet, nominal footprint, command-world displacement over remaining swing time, terrain height and the existing clearance envelope. Use complete Jacobians in GGN and the same residual in merit.
- [ ] Lower per-node root velocity tracking to regularization strength; keep zero/yaw semantics.
- [ ] Run command/coupled tests and commit `feat: couple command touchdown and root progress`.

### Task 6: Foot Leads Root At Startup

**Files:** modify `types.py`, `config.py`, `planner.py`, `test_coupled_gait.py`.

- [ ] Write RED zero→move and stop→restart tests for forward/back/lateral/diagonal. Measure published poses and require 20–80ms lead, root leak at most 0.5mm, scheduled swing leader, correct direction and valid stance anchors.
- [ ] Detect per-env command onset with translational deadband/direction-change cosine.
- [ ] During startup age zero, constrain command-axis root x1 motion to at most 0.5mm while swing target remains active; release after 1mm relative foot motion and force release at 80ms. Do not re-arm every half cycle.
- [ ] Run coupled, zero and stop regressions; commit `feat: make swing feet lead root startup`.

### Task 7: Scenario × Metric Cartesian Gate

**Files:** create `scenario_matrix.py`, `run_joint_acceptance.py`; modify crossing/stop probes and `test_behavior.py`.

- [ ] Write RED proving a scenario cannot omit a universal metric: crossing succeeds and collision is zero but stance slip fails; stop recovers support but root-first restart fails.
- [ ] Refactor flat, native small crossing, native stop, large obstacle and up/down-step paths to return raw traces plus scenario metadata.
- [ ] Feed every trace through one accumulator. Preserve old convenience properties but derive them from shared values.
- [ ] Implement JSON per-cell/worst/global reporting and nonzero exit on any applicable failure.
- [ ] Run all `Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti` tests; commit `test: joint all mpc scenario metrics`.

### Task 8: Full-Cycle Horizon And RTI Direction Exploration

> **Superseded audit section:** Task 8 through the original Task 14 below are retained only to explain the 2026-07-17 plan history. Do not execute their H16-H50 selection or variable `H_selected` instructions. Execute Tasks 8A-9A, then blocked Tasks 10A and 14A from the 2026-07-18 amendment instead.

**Files:** create `horizon_exploration.py`, `test_horizon_exploration.py`; modify `config.py`, `solver/line_search.py`, `solver/sqp_rti.py`, `test_solver.py` only when a focused RED identifies that component.

- [ ] Write RED tests for the exploration contract:

```python
def test_horizon_candidates_cover_one_full_fixed_trot_cycle():
    candidates = make_horizon_candidates((16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 50))
    assert [(c.horizon_steps, c.half_cycle_steps) for c in candidates] == [
        (16, 8), (20, 10), (24, 12), (30, 15), (40, 20), (50, 25)
    ]
    assert all(c.horizon_steps == 2 * c.half_cycle_steps for c in candidates)

def test_selection_uses_shortest_candidate_passing_every_metric():
    reports = [report(16, collision=1), report(20, collision=0), report(24, collision=0)]
    assert select_shortest_passing(reports).horizon_steps == 20
```

- [ ] Run RED:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=Go2Pvcnn /mnt/mydisk/lhy/anaconda3/envs/env_isaacsim/bin/python -m pytest \
  Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/test_horizon_exploration.py -q
```

Expected: FAIL because `make_horizon_candidates` and `select_shortest_passing` do not exist.

- [ ] Implement immutable candidate/report types and reject odd horizons or mismatched full-cycle configurations:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class HorizonCandidate:
    horizon_steps: int
    half_cycle_steps: int

def make_horizon_candidates(horizons: tuple[int, ...]) -> tuple[HorizonCandidate, ...]:
    if any(h < 16 or h > 50 or h % 2 for h in horizons):
        raise ValueError("horizon candidates must be even and within [16, 50]")
    return tuple(HorizonCandidate(h, h // 2) for h in horizons)

def select_shortest_passing(reports: Sequence[HorizonReport]) -> HorizonReport:
    passing = [report for report in reports if report.all_applicable_metrics_pass]
    if not passing:
        raise RuntimeError("no horizon candidate passes the complete Stage A contract")
    return min(passing, key=lambda report: report.horizon_steps)
```

- [ ] Add trace fields `line_search_used_base`, `line_search_alpha`, `max_joint_velocity`, `max_joint_step` and `max_delta_control` to the shared report. Do not turn them into semantic gates until the existing design threshold defines one; use them to localize why a candidate fails.

- [ ] Run a screening matrix for H16/H20/H24/H30/H40/H50 with identical losses and solver settings. Each run must keep `dt=0.02`, measured x0, x1 publication and `H=2*half_cycle`; record every JointMetrics value rather than a composite score.

- [ ] For the shortest horizons whose only remaining failures contain `line_search_used_base`, write a solver RED before changing the old optimization direction:

```python
def test_parallel_line_search_can_accept_a_bounded_small_step():
    result = parallel_line_search(
        base_control=torch.zeros(1, 1, 1),
        delta_control=torch.full((1, 1, 1), 10.0),
        merit_fn=lambda u: (u - 0.5).square().flatten(1).mean(1),
        alphas=(1.0, 0.25, 0.10, 0.05),
        delta_limit=torch.tensor([1.0]),
    )
    assert result.alpha.item() > 0.0
    assert result.control.abs().max().item() <= 1.0
```

- [ ] Implement a continuous optimization trust region inside candidate construction, not a semantic gate or post-publish repair. Apply per-control-component limits to the SQP direction before all alpha candidates, keep every alpha evaluation batched, and expose the limit through solver config. Run one variable at a time: first horizon, then delta limit, then alpha set.

- [ ] Run focused failing shape/speed/stop cells after each single change, then rerun the complete screening matrix. Remove candidates that improve collision by breaking stance slip, command tracking, foot lead, support, grounding or active swing.

- [ ] Commit the exploration/report infrastructure and the accepted single-cause solver change separately:

```bash
git commit -m "test: compare full-cycle joint mpc horizons"
git commit -m "fix: bound joint mpc rti search direction"
```

### Task 9: Close Stage A On One Selected Horizon

**Files:** only files implicated by focused failures; create a Stage A log and update `scenario_matrix.py`, `run_joint_acceptance.py` to record `H_selected`.

- [ ] Run the complete behavior gate for every screening survivor, not only its previously failing cell:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=Go2Pvcnn /mnt/mydisk/lhy/anaconda3/envs/env_isaacsim/bin/python \
  Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/run_joint_acceptance.py --stage behavior --horizon 20
```

Repeat with each surviving horizon. Expected: JSON includes `horizon_steps`, `half_cycle_steps`, every scenario-metric cell, worst values, opportunity counts and a nonzero exit for any failure.

- [ ] Select the shortest candidate for which every applicable inherited and new metric passes. Persist only that candidate as the production default `H_selected`; do not retain a runtime auto-selector in the planner.

- [ ] Run full joint and legacy pytest suites, real Isaac nine-command playback, and manager construction for `1/40/512/1024` using `H_selected`.

- [ ] Restore the packed query contract before accepting Stage A. The planner must perform one fixed-shape packed world query per RTI linearization; stance surface and measured/nominal link samples must be sections of that packed result rather than separate calls.

- [ ] For each failure, record one cell/metric, write or narrow one RED test, change one cause, rerun focused then unified tests. Never tune several weights in one attempt.

- [ ] Record `H_selected`, all worst-case behavior metrics, the rejected horizon reasons and current timing as non-gating evidence. Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "fix: close coupled joint mpc behavior gate"
```

## Stage B — Performance Gate

The frozen formal contract is `1024 x H_selected x 1000 <= 5000ms`; `H_selected` is the production horizon committed by Task 9, not a shorter benchmark substitute.

### Task 10: Profile Frozen Selected-Horizon Behavior

**Files:** modify `joint_mpc_rti_full_refresh_probe.py`, `test_performance.py`; create a profile log.

- [ ] Add a RED contract test requiring the probe to consume the production `H_selected` rather than H16:

```python
assert report.horizon_steps == JointMpcRtiCfg().runtime.horizon_steps
assert report.steps == 1000
assert report.num_envs == 1024
assert report.small_footprint == (11, 11)
assert report.large_footprint == (41, 41)
assert report.synchronous_field_updates == 1000
```

- [ ] On an idle GPU, record signed-field build, packed query/linearization, coupled solve, parallel line search, full P50/P95/P99/max and peak memory for 1024 environments and `H_selected`.

- [ ] Require field version `+1000`, nonfinite `0`, fixed realistic maps and complete Stage A losses. Commit probe/evidence:

```bash
git commit -m "test: profile selected horizon joint mpc pipeline"
```

### Task 11: Exact Batched Signed EDT If Field Dominates

**Files:** modify `terrain/csrc/work_efficient_edt_cuda.cu`, `.cpp`, `cuda_edt.py`, `test_terrain_fields.py` only when Task 10 shows field construction is the largest component.

- [ ] Write RED exactness/density tests for empty/full, single-cell, 11x11, 41x41, random and curved masks, including signed half-cell correction and interior gradients.

- [ ] Implement a true batched PBA-style exact transform: vertical bands, candidate merge, horizontal nearest-site propagation and exact squared-distance writeback for B×2 channels. Do not scan an occupied bbox per occupied cell and do not call a single-image API 2048 times.

- [ ] Keep fixed 151x151 workspaces; fuse outside/inside signed writeback only where CPU exact parity proves the result unchanged.

- [ ] Use 100-step screening, accept only candidates improving the realistic full refresh, remove rejected experiments, then commit:

```bash
git commit -m "perf: add batched exact signed edt"
```

### Task 12: MPX-Style Temporal And State-Space Parallel Solve

**Files:** modify `solver/primal_dual_ilqr.py`, create `solver/associative_tvlqr.py`, modify `solver/sqp_rti.py`, `test_solver.py`, `test_performance.py`.

- [ ] Read and map these reference functions before implementation:

```text
raw/mpx/mpx/jax_ocp_solvers/jax_ocp_solvers/primal_tvlqr.py:
  associative_scan based parallel backward TVLQR and forward rollout
raw/mpx/mpx/jax_ocp_solvers/jax_ocp_solvers/optimizers.py:
  multiple-shooting defects and parallel line search
raw/mpx/mpx/examples/multi_env.py:
  jit(vmap) multi-environment execution and warm-up timing
```

- [ ] Write RED dense-parity tests across `B=(1,40)`, `H=(16,H_selected)`: sequential dense Riccati, associative TVLQR and root-centered Schur must match `delta_state`, `delta_control` and merit improvement within `2e-5` for random SPD problems with nonzero root-leg cross blocks.

- [ ] Implement temporal composition with PyTorch's prototype operator:

```python
from torch._higher_order_ops.associative_scan import associative_scan

prefix = associative_scan(
    combine_conditional_value_factors,
    factor_elements,
    dim=1,
    reverse=True,
)
```

The combine operator must be mathematically associative and tested directly on three factors as `(a*b)*c == a*(b*c)`. Do not approximate or drop temporal/root-leg fill-in.

- [ ] Within each time factor, solve the root 6x6 plus four leg 3x3 arrowhead system by Cholesky leg factors, root Schur complement and back-substitution without explicit inverses. Route unsupported dense rows to the dense correctness path.

- [ ] Evaluate all line-search alphas in one `[B,A,H,18]` fixed-shape program, retain shifted warm starts and multiple-shooting defect diagnostics, and compile one static `H_selected` graph after Stage A.

- [ ] Benchmark isolated solve and full refresh. Accept the associative path only if parity passes, complete Stage A remains green and selected-horizon total improves. Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "perf: parallelize selected horizon joint mpc solve"
```

### Task 13: Close Stage B

**Files:** only measured bottlenecks; create final performance log.

- [ ] Use 100-step screening after each single-variable candidate, then run the formal idle-GPU probe:

```bash
H_SELECTED=$(PYTHONPATH=Go2Pvcnn /mnt/mydisk/lhy/anaconda3/envs/env_isaacsim/bin/python -c \
  'from extension.joint_mpc_rti.config import JointMpcRtiCfg; print(JointMpcRtiCfg().runtime.horizon_steps)')
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 PYTHONPATH=Go2Pvcnn \
  /mnt/mydisk/lhy/anaconda3/envs/env_isaacsim/bin/python \
  Go2Pvcnn/tests/joint_mpc_rti/joint_mpc_rti_full_refresh_probe.py \
  --num-envs 1024 --horizon "$H_SELECTED" --steps 1000 \
  --small-footprint 11 --large-footprint 41
```

- [ ] Require total `<=5000ms`, mean `<=5ms`, version `+1000`, nonfinite `0`, stable memory and the frozen realistic maps. Do not substitute H16 when `H_selected` is longer.

- [ ] After every accepted performance commit, rerun the complete Stage A unified gate at `H_selected`.

- [ ] Commit only with fresh evidence:

```bash
git commit -m "perf: close selected horizon joint mpc gate"
```

## Stage C — Final Joint Verification

### Task 14: Freshly Rerun Both Gates On One Candidate

**Files:** create one final combined log; update T302v todo/log/index.

- [ ] Record final `HEAD`, `H_selected` and tracked cleanliness.

- [ ] From scratch rerun Stage A at `H_selected`: unified behavior matrix, all joint tests, all legacy regressions, real Isaac viewer and dynamic batches.

- [ ] On the same `HEAD` and same `H_selected`, from scratch rerun Stage B: idle-GPU 1024×`H_selected`×1000 realistic synchronous full-refresh probe.

- [ ] If either fresh gate fails, return to the responsible stage; historical passes do not count and the performance threshold remains five seconds.

- [ ] Update notes with both fresh result sets and commit:

```bash
git commit -m "test: verify selected horizon behavior and performance"
```

- [ ] Run `git diff --check HEAD^ HEAD` and `git status --short --branch`; only the pre-existing user-owned NvStreamer and `raw/mpx/` untracked paths may remain.
