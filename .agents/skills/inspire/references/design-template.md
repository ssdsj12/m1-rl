# Inspire Design Template

Use this only after the user explicitly chooses `生成设计`. The primary agent must explicitly say the workflow is entering `brainstorming`, actually use the `brainstorming` workflow, then apply this template with the inspire-specific overrides below.

## Required Overrides

- discussion-first behavior remains the gate into this design
- no standalone implementation plan document
- no automatic todo writing after design
- design and todo remain explicit stage boundaries
- once the user explicitly advances past a completed stage, the next stage starts immediately without repeated approval
- implementation approval after todo is stage-level, not per-leaf
- once execution starts, it runs without further user approval until completion or objective blocker
- required subagent review before the design is ready for user review
- explicit stop after design review until the user chooses the next action

## Brainstorming Alignment

The design must include these required contents from the `brainstorming` path:

- clear problem framing
- goals and non-goals
- constraints
- alternative approaches with trade-offs
- recommended design
- testing or acceptance expectations
- explicit pause for review

The following are hard-required and must not be omitted or treated as optional guidance:

- constraints
- alternative approaches with trade-offs
- recommended design

## Review And Stop Rules

Before presenting the design as ready:

1. run the required subagent review
2. integrate review findings
3. re-run review if a substantive change alters requirements, transitions, responsibilities, or acceptance indicators
4. sync design-state todo memory and the official design-stage log
5. stop and wait for the user

After this path, offer only:

- `修改 design`
- `写 todo`
- `结束`

If the user says `继续` or `下一阶段` after the design boundary, treat that as approval to enter the todo stage.
