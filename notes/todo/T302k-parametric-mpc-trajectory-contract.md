# T302k Parametric MPC Trajectory Contract

## Current State

- T302k is the active implementation front for `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batch_mpc_planner`.
- The old dense residual planner route is retired. Current `plan_segment()` is parametric-only.
- Current active route is the approved low-small loss redesign plan: [T302k low-small loss redesign plan](T302k-low-small-loss-redesign-plan.md).
- Design source: [../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-parametric-low-small-loss-redesign.html](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-parametric-low-small-loss-redesign.html).
- Task 1 implementation restored the nominal extraction contract:
  - `semantic_policy.py` owns `ParametricTrajectoryNominal` and `build_parametric_nominal()`;
  - `planner.py` builds nominal once before the Adam loop and passes `nominal.command` as the planning command;
  - `decode_parametric_trajectory()` now consumes `nominal + variables` and no longer performs high/large semantic search inside decode.
- Task 2 added optional plane-terrain metadata:
  - `MpcPlannerTerrain.is_plane_terrain` is optional and remains `None` if unavailable;
  - scanner terrain construction, subset helpers, planner normalization, and MPC manager preserve it;
  - MPC manager infers plane terrain from IsaacLab `terrain_types` and `terrain_generator.sub_terrains` names, where only `flat` and `plane` are treated as plane.
- Task 3 added GPU low-small component circle approximation:
  - `semantic_geometry.py` provides `LowSmallCircles` and `low_small_component_circles()`;
  - helper returns fixed-shape centers/radii/valid/truncated tensors on the input device.
- Task 4 replaced the sampled low-small crossing loss key:
  - `parametric_losses.py` provides `parametric_touchdown_keepout_loss()`;
  - `_parametric_sampled_frame_losses()` now emits `parametric_touchdown_keepout` instead of `parametric_low_small_crossing`;
  - `low_small_crossing` config remains only for shared height-threshold/classification context and standalone legacy progress-loss tests.
- Task 5 added sampled swing target terrain clearance:
  - `parametric_losses.py` provides `parametric_swing_foot_clearance_loss()`;
  - `_parametric_sampled_frame_losses()` emits `parametric_swing_foot_clearance`.
- Task 6 added final FK realized collision:
  - `MpcLegPoints` exposes `shank_pos_world`;
  - `parametric_losses.py` provides `parametric_fk_body_leg_collision_loss()`;
  - `_parametric_sampled_frame_losses()` includes `parametric_fk_body_leg_collision`, so it participates in the Adam sampled loss path;
  - semantic MPC task config raises this weight to `120.0`.
- Task 7 added FK consistency:
  - `parametric_losses.py` provides `parametric_trajectory_fk_consistency_loss()`;
  - `_parametric_sampled_frame_losses()` includes `parametric_trajectory_fk_consistency`, so it participates in the Adam sampled loss path.
- Task 8 added plane-only root z target:
  - `parametric_losses.py` provides `parametric_plane_root_z_target_loss()`;
  - sampled `loss_breakdown/cost_breakdown` includes `parametric_plane_root_z_target`, gated by `terrain.is_plane_terrain`.
- Task 9 added plane low-small FK semantic collision probe metrics:
  - `mpc_low_small_reachable_crossing_probe.py` now exports `compute_plane_low_small_fk_metrics()`;
  - the helper marks test-only crossing legs from target foot XY semantic probes on plane terrain;
  - it reports FK foot/knee/shank semantic collision, first collision frame, per-part/per-leg counts, semantic clearance, and optimized-vs-FK foot error;
  - rolling replan diagnostics snapshot and reuse each segment's terrain rather than evaluating all frames against stale scanner state;
  - FK semantic collision is counted only for legs whose target foot XY probes triggered crossing, matching the approved 第 0 条 test scope;
  - JSONL rows include `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, command velocity, requested frames, horizon, replan count, and `terrain_is_plane`;
  - full GPU0 matrix passed hard acceptance on `12/20` crossing-covered rows, with `0` FK semantic collisions and max crossing FK error `0.0634m`.
- Current trajectory contract:
  - optimize touchdown `xy`; derive touchdown `z` from `height_at(terrain, touchdown_xy)`;
  - build root and foot cubic curves over the configured horizon;
  - sample frames for losses;
  - solve clamped IK and export FK-realized future feet;
  - keep frame0 root/foot state aligned to current IsaacLab state.
- Approved low-small redesign constraints:
  - 第 0 条 is test/diagnostic only, not an optimizer loss;
  - new losses are touchdown circle keepout, swing target terrain clearance, FK body/leg collision, optimized-vs-FK trajectory consistency, and plane root-z target;
  - no decode-time hard projection, touchdown snapping, or hard foot separation;
  - adding any new loss requires user approval.
- Parent evidence pages:

  - [T302i](T302i-viewer-realized-foot-mismatch.md): IK/FK reachability mismatch history.

## Next Step

- Continue with parameter inspection/tuning only if the user wants to reduce the four soft FK error rows above preferred `0.05m`. Do not add new losses or hard repairs without user approval.

## Node Details

### T302k.12 Replan Touchdown And FK Reachability

- why-created: IsaacLab checks show frame0 foot state is aligned, while planned touchdowns and clamped FK can still differ by large margins.
- evidence: `max_replan_initial_touchdown_to_current_foot_error` around `0.44-0.70m`; `max_touchdown_ik_fk_error` around `0.66-0.70m` in recent logs.
- current direction: solve in the parametric trajectory contract, probably by coupling touchdown anchors, swing endpoints, and reachable FK output rather than adding dense per-frame residuals.

### T302k.17 Nominal Extraction

- why-created: `decode_parametric_trajectory()` mixed nominal construction, semantic high/large command shaping, and optimization decode.
- current plan contract:
  - build `ParametricTrajectoryNominal` in `semantic_policy.py`;
  - pass `nominal.command` as planning command;
  - construct nominal before `for _ in range(steps):`;
  - decode consumes `nominal` and variables only.
- status: verify locally; commit pending.

### T302k.18 Low-Small Loss Redesign Plan

- why-created: user approved a new loss-only design for small obstacles and requested the todo page to act as the detailed implementation plan.
- plan: [T302k-low-small-loss-redesign-plan.md](T302k-low-small-loss-redesign-plan.md).
- hard guard:
  - no hard projection;
  - no touchdown snapping;
  - no hard foot separation;
  - tune only confirmed weights/parameters unless user approves a new loss.
