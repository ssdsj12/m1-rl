# AI Extension Planner Mapping

## Navigation

- doc role: AI mapping between raw planner and batched extension planner

## Current Architecture

Primary planner path is now:

- raw semantic baseline: `raw/kinematic_footsteps/scripts/go2fp/*`
- batched implementation: `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/*`
- Isaac / reward boundary: `extension/convention.py`, `extension/mdp/rewards_reference.py`, `extension/batched_planner/manager.py`

Old `extension/planner/*` and `extension/tasks/*` are no longer the target architecture.
Current helper/reference layer lives under `extension/reference/*`.

## Keep Three Planner Layers Separate

Do not collapse these into one concept:

1. `raw/kinematic_footsteps/scripts/go2fp/*`
   Original CPU, single-sample, semantic reference implementation.

2. `Go2Pvcnn/extension/reference/*`
   Current reference cache / raw bridge / placeholder reference layer.

3. `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/*`
   Current batched pure-GPU planner path used for the new runtime.

The right mental model is:

- raw CPU defines expected planner semantics
- batched GPU defines the training-time execution path

## Raw To Batched Mapping

- `raw/.../types.py`
  -> `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/types.py`
- `raw/.../config.py`
  -> `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/config.py`
- `raw/.../gait.py`
  -> `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/gait.py`
- `raw/.../foothold.py`
  -> `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/foothold.py`
- `raw/.../swing.py`
  -> `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/swing.py`
- `raw/.../terrain_estimator.py`
  -> `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/terrain_estimator.py`
- `raw/.../base_solver.py`
  -> `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/base_solver.py`
- `raw/.../ik.py`
  -> `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/ik.py`
- `raw/.../trajectory.py`
  -> `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/trajectory.py`

## Non-Raw Modules In The New Path

- `Go2Pvcnn/extension/convention.py`
- `Go2Pvcnn/extension/batched_planner/manager.py`
- `Go2Pvcnn/extension/mdp/rewards_reference.py`
- `Go2Pvcnn/go2_pvcnn/tasks/teacher_elevation_trajectory_env_cfg.py`
- `Go2Pvcnn/extension/viz/compare_trajectories.py`

## Isaac Lab Boundary Map

- `go2_pvcnn/tasks/teacher_elevation_trajectory_env_cfg.py`
  enables the planner-related scene sensor and reward terms
- `extension/convention.py`
  converts Isaac-facing state conventions into planner-facing tensors
- `extension/batched_planner/manager.py`
  owns replan cadence and current-phase cache consumption
- `extension/mdp/rewards_reference.py`
  compares live Isaac state against the cached planner reference

## Legacy Paths

Treat these as deleted historical paths:

- `Go2Pvcnn/extension/planner/*`
- `Go2Pvcnn/extension/mdp/reference_trajectory_events.py`
- `Go2Pvcnn/extension/tasks/teacher_elevation_trajectory_env_cfg.py`

Do not route new planner work there. Use `extension/reference/*` and `extension/batched_planner/*` instead.

## Joint MPC RTI Backend (2026-07-15)

- Optional backend: `Go2Pvcnn/extension/joint_mpc_rti/`, key `joint_mpc_rti`.
- Independent H16 rolling kinematic SQP-RTI with fixed trot, analytic FK/Jacobians, one world height field and semantic SDF.
- Shared boundaries only: task cfg, manager factory, `ReferenceTrajectoryCache`, reward and viewer adapters.
- `raw/mpx` informed fixed-program GPU structure but is not a dependency.
- Terrain path: current 151x151 scanner rows -> fixed-workspace warp-level exact EDT -> world query; distance gradients are analytic derivatives of bilinear distance interpolation, and line-search candidates gather original env field rows without duplicating full maps.
- Rolling support contract (2026-07-16): shifted joint controls remain the warm start, while root controls are re-based to the current command reference; mid-swing foot-over, late-swing safe landing, touchdown avoidance, and smooth-min support use continuous signed-distance terms with merit/LQ parity. Final functional acceptance covers 65 native stop phases, zero root drift, 100% crossing, zero per-part collision, and the real nine-command viewer.
